If you open your laptop to work and end up in tabs and feeds, you’re not alone. ADHD, heavy context switching and everyday distraction create decision fatigue. Focus One is a minimalist, visual Pomodoro timer that helps you monotask: pick one task, start the timer, and stay present—calm, zen focus without noise.

Built for study and work, Focus One creates a clear boundary for deep work and routines. A gentle visual loop anchors attention; simple Pomodoro presets (15, 20, 30 minutes) make time blocking effortless. It’s a small, kind tool for digital detox and procrastination—do one thing at a time.

Focus One is intentionally minimalist. A single task at the center reduces cognitive load, quiets anxiety, and makes starting easier. Students use it as a study timer; writers and developers pair it with time blocking; anyone practicing digital detox can rely on the visual anchor to reclaim presence.

Quick timers help you form tiny wins: tap a 3‑minute or 1‑minute countdown to break inertia, tidy a desk, or ease into a reading session. The classic tomato timer rhythm is here too—Pomodoro for consistent pacing without a complicated system.

Why this works: the ADHD mind responds well to concrete boundaries and gentle feedback. A visible, finite interval makes effort feel tangible. The GIF background is not decoration—it is a calm focus anchor that reminds you, moment to moment, what you chose to do.

Use it for deep work, daily study, or as a morning routine starter. Pair Focus One with Screen Time or site blockers to remove extra noise. When you finish a block, take a short breath, then begin the next. Progress compounds when you do one thing at a time.

Focus One is free at its core and ad‑free by design. If you are searching for an ADHD focus timer, visual timer, study timer or Pomodoro timer that does less—and therefore helps you do more—this is for you.
