## Happy New Year — from one human to another

Some years feel unbearably loud. Our feeds swell, our inboxes stack, and the signal gets lost in the noise. In the midst of this noisy era, what still makes life feel right is simple: having a good friend, a good sister, a good brother, and a good family — people who steady us when the world won’t.

This note is a small thank‑you to everyone who stood close and everyone who reached out. If you’ve had a difficult year, I hope the next one is kinder; if this was a good year, I hope you keep its warmth and carry it forward.

## 2026, a road ahead

There’s one promise I’m keeping to myself for the coming year: a moto journey in 2026, with good friends, to savor the road, the rain, the sun and the little towns that remind us we’re alive. It’s not about miles. It’s about hours well‑spent and stories well‑kept — the kind that stay in your bones.

## A gift for your story

I want you to have an easier way to keep your own story. That’s why we’re sharing promo codes for our app — Chronicle: Journal Calendar — so you can start or deepen your daily practice of recording life’s important moments. Notes, tasks, feelings, photos, milestones — layered together on one calm timeline.
