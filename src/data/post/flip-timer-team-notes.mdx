We built Flip Timer around a simple truth: when you want to begin, friction matters most. In HIIT and Tabata sets, CrossFit WOD rounds, Pomodoro study/work blocks, or kitchen cook routines and egg timing, tapping through menus taxes momentum. Motion control removes that tax—one flip, and you’re underway, with an interval timer that matches your pace.

The goal was a timer that moves with you. Flip to start, lay the phone flat to pause, shake to reset. A big countdown display with a clear progress bar you can see across the room keeps you present. Presets match real life—1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45 minutes, plus 30‑second and 2‑minute intervals.

Design principles we kept:

- Motion first: gestures over buttons—faster to start, fewer decisions.
- Clear feedback: a big digital clock and progress bar, readable at a distance.
- Minimal controls: start, pause, reset—no complex setup mid‑routine.
- Real presets: HIIT, Tabata, WOD, kitchen, Pomodoro—choose once, flow longer.

We tested in real contexts: sweaty hands in HIIT, flour‑covered fingers in baking, deep work sessions needing visible endpoints. Users told us the timer “gets out of the way” while still being obvious enough to trust. That balance—low friction with high clarity—guided every iteration.

The core experience is free and ad‑free. Future advanced modes and themes may arrive as optional upgrades, but the flip‑to‑start timing you rely on will remain central. Our roadmap follows the same principle: fewer choices, faster starts, and polished details that make everyday timing feel effortless.
