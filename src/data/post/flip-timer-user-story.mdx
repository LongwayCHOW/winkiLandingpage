Stop tapping mid‑set or with flour on your fingers. Flip Timer is a motion‑controlled countdown and interval timer you operate hands‑free—perfect for workout and exercise, CrossFit WODs, Tabata and HIIT intervals, kitchen cook routines and egg timing, or a Pomodoro block for study and work.

Set any timer in a second. Flip to start a 1, 5, 10, 15 or 30 minute countdown. It’s the fastest countdown clock for gym, kitchen and focused tasks. Need a 20 or 45 minute session, or a 30‑second/2‑minute interval? Flip and go.

A timer that moves with you:

- Flip to one of the four sides to start a preset countdown. Lay the phone flat to pause; shake to reset.
- Large, clear digital display with a visual progress bar—easy to glance at from a distance.
- Humane presets for everyday routines: 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45 minutes; plus 30 seconds and 2 minutes.

The perfect workout companion:

- HIIT & Tabata: switch sets and rests without touching the screen; your interval timer keeps up with your pace.
- CrossFit & WOD clock: time your Workout of the Day reliably—focus on form, not your phone.
- Any exercise routine: from yoga stretches to circuit training, flip for clean intervals and stay in flow.

More than fitness:

- Kitchen companion: a friendly kitchen timer when your hands are covered in flour; works like a simple egg timer.
- Study & work: use it as a Pomodoro timer for focused blocks and calm momentum.

Why it works: motion control removes friction at the exact moment you want to begin. One flip is faster than tapping through menus, and the visible progress bar keeps you present. When starting is easy, consistency follows.

Flip Timer is free at its core and ad‑free. If you want the fastest way to set a timer—gym, study, work or kitchen—flip your phone and get moving.
