We designed MeowTalkie around a simple idea: clear signals build trust. Cat chat and sound should be intuitive — not chaotic or noisy. A clean, ad‑free communicator makes it easy to send sonically clear calls, start playful moments and support positive training.

Design principles we kept:

- Sonically Clear Signals: Consistent cat call patterns and labeled commands reduce guesswork and support learning.
- Calm, Minimal UI: A simple soundboard and obvious actions — less clutter, more playful focus.
- Real Cat Moments: Playtime, training and bonding are first‑class — every sound invites interaction.
- Zero Ads: No interruptions. Communication should feel present and friendly.

What we heard from users:

- “Curious Trill” sparks play with shy cats and rescues.
- “Annoyed Hiss” discourages counter jumps without shouting.
- Clear labels help families keep training consistent.

Why it works:

- Cats respond to rhythm and consistency. Simple, repeatable signals build recognition over time.
- Humans need feedback too — visible names and categories make practice easy.
- An ad‑free space keeps attention on the moment — not on a banner.

Our roadmap stays practical:

- Expand sound packs for different personalities — playful kitten, calm companion, adventurous explorer.
- Refine categories for training (Come Here, Food Time, Leave It) and play (Meow, Purr, Trill).
- Keep the communicator lightweight and friendly — quick to open, quick to act.

Billing, purchases and policy:

- In‑app purchase users unlock premium sound packs. Prices range from $0.99 to $5.99, subject to real‑time updates.
- Purchases are billed to the iTunes account after payment.
- Subscriptions are not currently available. If launched, rules will follow the App Store’s renewal policy.
