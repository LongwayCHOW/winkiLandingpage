We began with a simple tension: phones warning “Storage Full” versus the fear of deleting a memory. Space vs. story. Photo Swipe Cleaner was designed as a gallery cleaner to reduce anxiety—declutter and organize with clarity, delete duplicates and junk, and keep what matters.

We didn’t try to make deletion faster; we tried to make decisions clearer. A large viewer and human‑scale controls help you compare near‑duplicates and blurry shots. Plain language supports choices. A safety net ensures a wrong swipe doesn’t erase a meaningful picture. Confidence grows when undo is obvious and reliable.

Design principles we kept close:

- Safety First, Always: Deleted images move to a temporary bin. Undo is obvious, immediate, and reliable. Confidence grows when you can correct mistakes.
- Clarity Over Speed: We prioritize clear decisions over rapid taps. A large viewer and generous spacing help you recognize duplicates and blurry shots, not just remove them.
- Mindful Swipe: Left and right are intentional. Left removes clutter—screenshots, accidental captures, near‑duplicates. Right keeps what matters—faces, light, moments. The interaction stays consistent so you never guess.
- Calm UI, No Noise: An interface free of ads or visual clutter improves focus. The app’s job is to help you think and feel, not rush you.

What we learned from real use:

- People want a cleaner that respects hesitation. Many users take a second look before deleting—and that’s good.
- A safety net changes behavior. When undo is easy, users feel free to move faster without stress.
- Rediscovery matters. A cleaner that helps you notice the best photo in a set—that one frame where the smile is true—adds emotional value, not just storage gains.

How we balance power and care:

- We keep the core swipe experience lean and satisfying.
- We build optimizations that matter—fast cache clearing and large file removal—without introducing risky shortcuts.
- We explore smarter tools (like duplicate detection and size‑based sorting) with an “assist, don’t override” philosophy. You decide; the app supports.

A small product with a big promise:

- One hand. One decision per photo. A habit you can keep.
- Clear visuals and an undo buffer that makes tough calls easier.
- A camera roll that feels lighter, with the best moments easier to find.

Our commitment is simple: the core experience—the mindful swipe, clear decisions, and a reliable safety net—will remain central. Advanced features will expand capabilities, but they won’t compromise the feeling of calm control.

If you’ve felt torn between space and memory, we built Photo Swipe Cleaner for you. Clean up confidently. Keep the moments that matter.
