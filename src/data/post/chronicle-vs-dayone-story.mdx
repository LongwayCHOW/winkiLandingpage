### **[A Note from the Developer]**

Before we talk about **Chronicle**, we need to talk about the elephant in the room: **Day One**.

If you journal, you know it. It’s the giant. The "App of the Year" winner. It’s perfect. It’s like a **5-star hotel in the city center**—luxurious, modern, with a concierge (AI) to handle everything, and elevators that glide silently to the top floor.

It is perfect. **But if it’s so perfect, why are people still looking for something else?**

### 🗣️ Voices from the Skyscraper

I’ve spent a lot of time reading comments from long-time Day One users on Reddit and forums. I saw something interesting. It wasn’t just praise. It was **exhaustion**.

> _"I get pennied to death on subscription services... I'm not keen on renting software like I do streaming music."_
> — _Reddit user matcha_man_

> _"Updates feel increasingly lackluster... Stagnation equals regression."_
> — _Day One Forum member_

> _"This is a freaking Journaling app... it's not worth paying $50 EACH YEAR!"_
> — _Reddit user_

These voices tell a truth: **Perfection has a price.** And that price isn't just the subscription fee—it’s the feeling of **distance**.

When you stay in a hotel, it’s nice. But it’s not **home**. You can’t hammer a nail into the wall to hang a picture. You are just a guest paying rent. If you stop paying, the room is no longer yours.

### 🏡 Why Chronicle?

If Day One is the 5-star hotel, **Chronicle is a small wooden cabin in the woods.**

Let’s be honest. Chronicle is the underdog. I don’t have a massive cloud team. I don’t have AI to analyze your tone. Heck, just yesterday, I was up all night fixing a simple "rotation animation" bug. (Thanks for telling me about it—it’s smooth as silk now! ✨)

**But this cabin belongs to YOU.**

#### 1. It’s Yours, Not Rented.

I don’t want your data. I don’t want to lock you into a forever subscription. Chronicle is built to be **local-first**. This is your corner of the world. You shouldn’t have to pay rent just to visit your own memories.

#### 2. It’s "Enough".

In a world that wants to do everything, Day One keeps adding more—video, social, AI... But maybe, just maybe, all you need is a clean space to write, a photo that actually loads, and a quiet place to keep your thoughts.

_We don’t need to stuff everything into a journal. We just need to write._

#### 3. It Has Warmth.

Day One is a tool. Chronicle is a companion.
You won’t shout into the void here. I am right here. Every pixel polished, every bug squashed (like that annoying image preview issue!), is me, a real person, connecting with you.

### Chronicle isn't here to beat Day One.

Day One is for people who want a "Perfect Digital Library."
**Chronicle is for people who want to "Live and Remember."**

We are still building this cabin. It’s not fancy yet. But every plank is laid with care, and the door is always open.

Thank you for being an early resident of Chronicle.
Let's build this home together. 🏡
